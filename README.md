Going through PluralSight Vue.js Getting Started course

## Overview
This course is a great review of the API with a detailed look at most (if not all) of the methods. It is definitely for beginners. It does not cover building an actual project though it does use a project as a reference. It also does not go into build systems and getting started with compilation and bringing in more of the JS ecosystem to work with Vue.
